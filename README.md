# Forest-Fire-Detection
This repository contains a deep learning-based approach for detecting forest fires using image classification. The model is built using TensorFlow and trained on the Wildfire Dataset. It utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification and is optimized for GPU acceleration.

Features and Improvements:

Dataset Handling: Downloads and processes the Wildfire Dataset from Kaggle.

GPU Optimization: Ensures the use of a GPU for faster training and inference.

CNN Architecture: Implements a CNN model for classifying images into 'fire' and 'nofire' categories.

Data Augmentation: Utilizes ImageDataGenerator to enhance the training dataset.

Visualization: Displays sample images from the dataset for better understanding.

Improved Efficiency: Optimized model training with dropout layers to reduce overfitting.
